# TODO Scanner
A simple tool that scans a project folder for `TODO` and `FIXME` comments and shows the results in a clear way. This project is part of my portfolio as I prepare for software engineering apprenticeship programs. It’s focused on code organization, basic tooling, and clean documentation.

## 🚀 What it does
- Looks through files in a project folder
- Finds lines that contain `TODO` or `FIXME`
- Shows the file name, the line number, and the text of the comment
This helps quickly identify unfinished tasks or reminders left in code.

## 🛠 Tech stack
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Node.js
- (Depending on the template) Vite or a basic front-end setup
- Simple project tooling (scripts, build, tests)

## ▶️ How to run it
These steps may vary slightly based on the project template, but this is the standard way to run it locally:

1. Install dependencies:
   npm install

2. Start the local development server:
   npm run dev

3. Open the link shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) to view the app in your browser.

## 🧪 Tests
If the project includes tests, you can run them with:
npm test

## 📁 Project Structure (example)

  utils/
  App.tsx
  main.tsx

(This may vary depending on how the project was generated.)

## 🌱 Why I built this
I created this project to practice understanding how file scanning works, working with a small codebase, running and testing a modern JavaScript/TypeScript project, and using GitHub to publish and document my work.

## 🚧 Future improvements
- Support additional file types and comment formats
- Add the option to export scan results (JSON, CSV)
- Add filtering options
- Build a simple UI to display scan results visually
