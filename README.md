# TODO Scanner
A simple tool that scans a project folder for `TODO` and `FIXME` comments and displays the results in a clear way. This project is part of my portfolio as I prepare for software engineering apprenticeship programs. It focuses on code organization, clean documentation, and working with a small TypeScript/React codebase.

## 🚀 What it does
- Scans files in a selected project folder  
- Detects lines that contain `TODO` or `FIXME`  
- Displays the file name, line number, and extracted comment  
This helps quickly identify unfinished tasks or reminders left in code.

## 🛠 Tech stack
- TypeScript  
- React  
- Vite (front-end tooling)  
- Basic project tooling (scripts, build, formatting)

## ▶️ How to run it
These steps may vary slightly based on the environment, but this is the standard way to run it locally:

1. Install dependencies:  
   npm install

2. Start the local development server:  
   npm run dev

3. Open the link shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) to view the app in your browser.

## 🌱 Why I built this
I created this project to practice understanding how file scanning works, working with a small codebase, using modern React/TypeScript tooling, and publishing clean, well-documented work on GitHub.

## 🚧 Future improvements
- Support additional file types and comment formats  
- Add the option to export scan results (JSON, CSV)  
- Add filtering options (TODO vs FIXME, file types, etc.)  
- Add a richer UI for visualizing results
